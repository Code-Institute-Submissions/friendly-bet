Welcome john00neill,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Description

This project is based on a company specialising in 'friendly betting' games, that is; games where users play various
games against each other for money, but mainly for fun and enjoyment. This type of game is also known as pooled betting' 
as it is more similar to a lottery format than traditional betting/gambling, which in reality is against highly qualified 
risk analysts and probably experts.  

This project and website's aim to give users an understanding of the purpose of the platform, the games available (and how they can play them) and the rules for each game. There is also a section
explaining the various sports covered so that fans can check if their favourite sport is available.    

Users can navigate by game type or sport. The following three pages make up the website project:
 - index.HTML
 - gametypes.HTML
 - sports.html




To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
