Welcome john00neill,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Description

This project is based on a company specialising in 'friendly betting' games, that is; games where users play various
games against each other for money, but mainly for fun and enjoyment. This format is also known as 'pooled betting'. 
It is more similar to a lottery format than traditional sports betting/gambling, which is betting against bookmakers.  

The project and website's aim to give users an understanding of the purpose of the platform, the games available, how they can play each game and the rules. There is also a section
explaining the various sports covered where sports fans can check which sports are covered on the website.    

Users can navigate by game type or sport. The following three pages make up the website project:
 - index.html
 - gametypes.html
 - sports.html

## User Stories

External users of the site have the following goals (brackets include the relevant area of website goals are achieved):
1.	Find out about the website (index.html and sports.html)
2.	Find out about the games (gametypes.html)
3.	Determine whether the games will be fun / enjoyable (index.html/why us?)
4.	Find out how the game works (gametypes.html)
5.	Understand the rules (gametypes.html - Modals included for specific game rules)  

The site owner has the following goals (brackets include the relevant area of website goals are achieved):
1.	Generate user interest in playing the games (index.html/why us?)
2.	Allow users to easily understand the games and why they are fun (index.html/why us? and gametypes.html)
3.	Make them likely to tell their friends about the games and share them (index.html/why us?)
4.	Users associate upcoming sporting events with the games themselves e.g. Premier League, Masters Golf, 
    Grand National etc (sports.html)

## User Experience (UX)

The brand colours of Friendly Bet are blue and orange, with a hint of white. The reason for the colour choice is 
that blue denotes trust (important for a site offering social betting games for the first time) and orange 
represents fun. Significantly from a design and UX perspective, blue and orange are complementary pairs on the 
color wheel. The branding colour combination is maintained in the logo and navbar of the header, as well as the 
footer via the branded blue background, white h5 headings and branded orange h4 headings. Users are never far
from branded navigation.

The images on the home page show groups of friends gathering, cheering and coming together to enjoy sport, which is precisely
what the brand is about. The images in the gametypes page are more representative of the games themselves - Last Man Standing
requires the winner to be the only player remaining, Sweepstakes are all about putting money in a kity/pot and watching the
action, while Prediction Competitions are more about studying the form, probabilities etc.

The footer section clearly defines (using branded links) where users can contact the company, keep in
touch via social channels or sign up to the newsletter for updates.

The benefits of playing games offered by 'Friendly Bet' are clearly dipicted with green tick icons, quickly drawing them
to the attention of users in the 'Why us?' section of index.html.


To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
